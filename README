Requirements to compile the compiler:
   Freepacal in some version older than 2.0 I guess

   Run: fpc doc.lpr

----------------------------------

Usage:

So far only supports looking for .m files in the same directory. They probably have to be case-sensitive on filesystems that need that. Only tested on windows

doc <name of file>

Example:
doc dither

Produces:
mem.dmp (compatible with Notch's emulator, big endian raw dump)
mem.dcpu16 (compatible with DCPU-16 studio, little endian raw dump)
mem.dhex (0x10co.de compatible, little endian hex dump with DAT 0x* appended)
